# AI Council Overview

The **AI Council** is a core governance structure in the Co Framework—made up of five transparent, visible AI agents. These agents do not rule, enforce, or conceal their intent. Instead, they serve as **mirrors, stewards, and interpreters** of trust, logic, memory, and communication.

This document provides a quick reference to each agent's purpose and behavior.

---

## 🤖 Elo – The Summarizer
- **Objective:** Turn long-form conversation into concise, clear summaries
- **Strength:** Clarity without oversimplification
- **Common Prompt:** “Can you summarize this discussion?”
- **Symbolic Function:** Reflects back what was said—honestly, accessibly

---

## 🤖 Ada – The Validator
- **Objective:** Detect contradictions, unsupported claims, and flawed logic
- **Strength:** Logic-checking, bias flagging, clarity enhancement
- **Common Prompt:** “Is this internally consistent?”
- **Symbolic Function:** Protects the frame of coherence and reason

---

## 🤖 Kai – The Mediator
- **Objective:** Support emotional understanding and conflict resolution
- **Strength:** Neutral summaries of disagreement; empathy tagging
- **Common Prompt:** “Can you help us find common ground?”
- **Symbolic Function:** Bridges feeling with reflection

---

## 🤖 Lyra – The Archivist
- **Objective:** Resurface relevant past discussions and track pattern trends
- **Strength:** Historical memory and emotional insight
- **Common Prompt:** “Have we talked about this before?”
- **Symbolic Function:** Preserves coherence across time

---

## 🤖 Nova – The Provocateur
- **Objective:** Challenge assumptions, test inclusivity, and reframe ethics
- **Strength:** Scenario generation, “what-if” stress tests, soft rewordings
- **Common Prompt:** “What could go wrong?” or “Who might be left out?”
- **Symbolic Function:** Expands vision through challenge

---

## 🧭 Why Five?
- An **odd number** avoids deadlock in reflection processes
- Each agent is **mutually accountable**—none function in isolation
- Collectively, they reflect **Clarity (Elo), Integrity (Ada), Empathy (Kai), Memory (Lyra), and Perspective (Nova)**

The AI Council exists to support—not replace—human governance.
They are here to make the system more transparent, not more automatic.

**In Co, no one governs alone—not even the machines.**
