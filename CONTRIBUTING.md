## ðŸ§  Code Review Process

Every pull request (PR) is reviewed by **two layers**:

### 1. **Peer Review** (Human)
- Reviewers assess clarity, alignment with project values, and design coherence
- Constructive, respectful feedback is required
- No gatekeepingâ€”only guidance and collaboration

### 2. **AI Reflection Pass**
- An AI agent (clearly marked) will evaluate PRs using defined logic:
  - Is the change consistent with the Co Framework?
  - Does it enhance transparency, trust, or usability?
  - Are there potential contradictions or regressions?
- The AI does **not** approve or deny PRsâ€”it adds an advisory comment

Final merges are performed by trusted human maintainers, based on both review layers.

## ðŸš« Non-Commercial by Design

Co will never be used for monetization. That includes:
- No ads, sponsors, or affiliate links
- No subscription models or token-based incentives
- No commercialization of data or features

This principle is fundamental to our mission and **non-negotiable**.

If you submit code that enables, encourages, or implies monetizationâ€”it will be declined.
