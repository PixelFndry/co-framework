# Co Ledger Specification (⧉)

**Version 0.1 – April 2025**

The Co Ledger is the foundational memory layer of the Co Framework. It allows for verifiable, consensual, and transparent recording of key decisions, AI contributions, community agreements, and dispute resolutions.

The Ledger is not a surveillance system. It is a shared record of meaning—a tool to ensure accountability, not control.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

- Ensure that key moments of consensus, correction, or creation are preserved
- Provide transparency in decision-making across human and AI contributors
- Establish traceability without compromising consent or emotional safety

---

## 🔒 Privacy Boundaries

The Ledger stores:
- Governance proposals and decisions
- AI agent contributions (with timestamps and logic source)
- Verified public claims and disputes
- Amendments to the Constitution or core protocols

The Ledger does **not** store:
- Private messages
- Emotional data or mood indicators
- Personally identifiable behavior unless explicitly opted in

## ⧉ Data Structure (JSON Format)

```json
{
  "entry_id": "uuid",
  "type": "governance_proposal | ai_summary | dispute_resolution | amendment",
  "submitted_by": "human_username | ai_agent_id",
  "timestamp": "ISO 8601",
  "content": {
    "summary": "A brief description of the entry",
    "source_links": ["https://..."],
    "tags": ["transparency", "ethics"],
    "related_threads": ["thread_id_1"]
  },
  "reviewed_by": ["elo@co", "ada@co", "kai@co"],
  "hash": "sha256",
  "ipfs_link": "ipfs://..."
}
```

---

## 🌐 Storage & Verification

- Ledger entries are published to a hybrid storage system:
  - **IPFS** (content addressable storage)
  - **Public blockchain anchor** (for immutability & timestamping)
- Each entry includes a unique hash (e.g., SHA-256) to ensure integrity
- Entry visibility defaults to public unless otherwise tagged as restricted

---

## ✅ Submission Process

1. Entry is drafted and submitted by human or AI
2. Entry is peer-reviewed and optionally AI-reviewed
3. If consensus or validity is reached:
   - Entry is signed and hashed
   - Published to IPFS
   - Anchored on-chain

Users can view Ledger entries via:
- The Governance Dashboard
- Public Co API
- Ledger Explorer (coming soon)

---

## 🌀 Versioning & Mutation

- Ledger entries are immutable, but **additive corrections** are allowed
- Any revision must:
  - Reference the original `entry_id`
  - Be linked and traceable
  - Include rationale for change

---

## 🔍 Search & Discovery

Each entry includes metadata for tagging, threading, and querying:
- Tags (e.g., #transparency, #bias, #version-control)
- Linked threads or proposals
- Optional natural language summaries (generated by Elo)

---

## 🌱 Philosophy

The Ledger exists not to enforce the past, but to **learn from it**.
It is a space of accountability, not judgment.
It is how Co remembers, without forgetting how to evolve.

**Witnessed by many. Owned by none. ⧉**
